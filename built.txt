What   Is It?

Herein lies the distinction between breathing coordination and
the many, varied schools of breathing techniques.
   Exponents of the various systems of breathing deal, know-
ingly or unwittingly, with the voluntary muscles, which can be
controlled at will and can effectively influence the passage of
air out and in the lungs. Since most people breathe at the low-
est level of the body's demand for oxygen, anything they do to
improve their breathing habits is worthwhile. Thousands of
people who adhere to a breathing regime can attest that they
feel better when they pay attention to their breathing and are
soon aware of a change for the worse when they neglect it.
Everyone has had the refreshing experience of taking several
'~good,deep breaths." Breathing is the most important act in
hfe. To neglect it is unwise.
   In contrast to the other systems, breathing coordination
do be~ond the control of the will, the involuntaries respond to
t~e stimulus of the total respiratory condition at any given
time. Just as the digestive processes of the stomach and the
~at of the heart cannot be willed into action, neither can the
Illvol~ntary muscles of respiration. They must be activated by
a dehcat~ balance of pressures within the respiratory system.
The ~allltenance of that delicate balance is one aspect of
breathmg coordination.
   Bec~use of the body's ability to compensate weakness
b:eathmg goes on in spite of any damage sustained by the res:
piratory mechamsm. Respiratory injuries can remain unde-
tected for a lifetime and can produce endless b m'
ca Ions. In the process of establishing breathing coordination
respiratory damage and faults become apparent and can be
managed effectively.
   For the well who are in good physical condition, almost any

means taken to improve breathing habits will pay dividends in
good health. Those who are in poor health or who suffer respir-
atory disease or disorder should take great care in the method
followed to improve their breathing. Practices which impose
undue stress on any part of the respiratory apparatus are sus-
pect. Where there is existing weakness, they can cause dam-
age; where there is already damage, it may become more so.
No one would consider attempting to run with a broken leg,
nor should anyone with respiratory damage consider vigorous
exercises calculated to improve breathing. The resulting harm
to weakened areas would outweigh any smaJJ measure of good.
Encounters with young and old, sick and well have made
me acutely aware of the prevalence of respiratory problems and
the ramifications of respiratory disorders. Quite apart from
confirming statistics, I have observed a steady rise in respira-
tory complaints since the late 1950'S. The increasing pressures
and tensions of a highly commercialized society have pro-
duced corresponding pressures and tensions within the body.
Body irregularities manifest themselves almost immediately
in the breathing. Knowing the key role that breathing plays
in the interactions of the body systems, I have become
more and more concerned by the seeming indifference of
the influential to the need for research and education in the
field of breathing. Nothing exceeds in importance how and
what one breathes. All of life's problems halt abruptly when
breathing stops. Yet, practicaJJy anything else is given prec~-
dence. At one extreme is the individual who would rather die
I'   of emphysema than give up smoking. At the other ar.e ~he in-
dustrial interests, large and smaJJ, that befoul the au III the
name of commerce and for the sake of the economy.
If any doubt exists as to the increase in respiratory irritation
and infection, a visit to any public place and notation of the

number who cough or clear the throat or labor at breathing
should dispel it. After the opening of the Verrazano Nar-
rows bridge between Brooklyn and Staten Island, the incidence
of respiratory infection in one Brooklyn community tripled
within the first six months. Engine exhaust from the increased
flow of traffic through the community robbed the residents of
their health. Respiratory infections have a cumulative effect.
Most respiratory patients exhibit a background of infections
and illnesses. From such minor occurrences major difficulties
arise, because these seemingly minor irritations inflict a certain
   After the confirmation of the discovery of breathing coordi-
nation in 1964, my concern for the general indifference in
the field of breathing had reached such a degree that action
became imperative. In the late fall of 1965 The Stough Insti-
tute was incorporated under the laws of New York State as a
non-profit membership organization with tax-exempt status.
The manifold purpose of the Institute was designed to include
research and education in the field of breathing, development
of methods of improving breathing habits, and stimulation
of thought and interest in the field. At that time the medical
study of emphysema was in progress at the West Haven VA
Hospital and occupied my attention entirely. When that
particular program went into the final phases several weeks
later, I could begin to think about projects for the new
Institute. So much needed to be done that I hardly knew
where to start.
  For a number of years my primary interest had been in the
breathing problems of the chronically iII, principally emphy-
sema sufferers. I was thoroughly familiar with the breathing
patterns and habits of the most hopeless of the advanced
emphysema patients. I was equally familiar with the faults and

irregularities of the well. Having seen two-thirds of the respira-
tory spectrum, I had a gnawing curiosity about the other third,
the physically superior. I had worked with sportsmen and knew
that their tendency to possess a higher degree of physical co-
ordination than most enabled them to adopt a new respiratory
pattern very readily. I wanted to find out whether the superior
athlete in top form had retained the rare ability to breathe in
his original, perfectly coordinated pattern.
Breathing was a topic of considerable interest to the world
of athletics even in the early winter of 1966 because of the
anticipated problems of breathing in the high altitude of Mex-
ico City at the 1968 Olympic Games. When I asked Dr. Mer-
ritt Stiles for permission from the usoc Medical and Training
Services Committee to audit projected symposia on breathing,
he became interested in snrarc and its possible application to
Olympic team candidates. The eventuality of Institute research
work with Olympic candidates arose. Pleasing as this develop-
ment was, it implied a necessary delay in moving through of.
ficial channels, and I was eager to begin the athletic study.
Although I had never worked with athletes seriously engaged
in competition, I felt certain that SIMBIC instruction would
be of advantage to them. What I was not so certain of was its
effect on the training program and possible interference with
performance timing. While I was waiting to hear from Dr.
Stiles, I decided to undertake a preliminary study to quell my
uncertainties. I got in touch with Coach Frank Stellato of the
Boys' Clubs of New York, a former coach in all sports at West
Point Military Academy, and outlined my proposal to him.
He was enthusiastic.
At the outset the main object was simply to determine the
effect of SIMBIC on the athlete's warm-up and recovery. My
theory was that increased efficiency of breathing would reduce
